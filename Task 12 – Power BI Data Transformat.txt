Task 12 – Power BI Data Transformation Notes

Dataset Used:
Superstore Dataset (CSV)

Tool Used:
Power BI Desktop – Power Query Editor

Data Transformation Steps Performed:

1. Imported the Superstore dataset into Power BI using the Text/CSV option.

2. Opened Power Query Editor to perform data cleaning and transformation before loading the data model.

3. Removed unnecessary columns such as Row ID and Postal Code to reduce data redundancy.
   Renamed column headers to maintain consistency and readability.

4. Checked for missing values in numeric and categorical columns.
   Replaced null values in numeric columns like Profit and Discount where required.

5. Corrected data types for all columns.
   Converted Order Date and Ship Date columns to Date type using locale-based conversion
   to handle regional date format issues.

6. Split the Customer Name column into meaningful components where required.
   Merged location-related columns for better geographical analysis.

7. Created conditional columns using Power Query:
   - Profit_Status column to classify orders as Profit or Loss.
   - Sales_Band column to group sales into Low, Medium, and High categories.

8. Applied all transformations and loaded the cleaned data into the Power BI data model.

9. Built interactive dashboard visuals using transformed data, including category-wise sales,
   profit distribution, sales trends over time, and sales segmentation.

Final Outcome:
The dataset was successfully cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis.
This task improved understanding of real-world data preprocessing using Power Query
before building analytical dashboards.
