# Task 12: Power BI – Data Transformation using Power Query

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is part of a **Data Analyst Internship Task** focused on performing real-world data transformation using **Power BI Power Query**.  
The objective is to clean, transform, and prepare raw data for effective dashboard visualization.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor
- CSV Dataset (Superstore)

---

## 📁 Dataset
**Superstore Dataset**  
Contains information related to:
- Orders and shipping dates
- Customer details
- Product categories and sub-categories
- Sales, profit, discount, and quantity

---

## 🔄 Data Transformation Steps
The following transformations were performed using **Power Query**:

1. Imported the dataset into Power BI
2. Removed unnecessary columns and renamed headers
3. Handled missing values appropriately
4. Corrected data types (dates, numbers, text)
5. Fixed date format issues using locale-based conversion
6. Split customer name into meaningful components
7. Created conditional columns:
   - Profit Status (Profit / Loss)
   - Sales Band (Low / Medium / High)
8. Applied transformations and loaded data model

## 📈 Dashboard Visualizations
The following visuals were created using transformed data:

- **Bar Chart**: Category-wise Total Sales
- **Pie Chart**: Profit vs Loss distribution
- **Bar Chart**: Sub-category vs Profit
- **Slicer**: Region / Segment filter

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- `task12_transform.pbix` – Power BI project file
- `dashboard_export.pdf` – Exported dashboard
- `transformation_notes.txt` – Summary of data cleaning steps
- Dataset CSV file

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Importance of data cleaning before visualization
- Handling date format issues using locale
- Using conditional columns for segmentation
- Creating meaningful dashboards for business insights

---

## ✅ Final Outcome
This project demonstrates practical skills in **data preparation, transformation, and visualization**, which are essential for real-world data analyst roles.
